        "Simply by looking at this silency map represented as an heat map we can wondering or argue different observation, like the fact that as the noise increase gradients magnitudes becomes more an more \"smooth\", in the sense that their absolute value tends to decrease with respect to the vanilla ones.\\\n",
        "Or we can observe some kind of structure in the columns where, for example, \"area_worste\" feature is really a very strong informative one. By the way we will investigate about it in the next section comparing by class $c$ with a global silency map.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In this section the thing I want to emphasise is to try to understand what level of noise is best to find the most informative features. The concept makes a lot of sense in the example of the images in [2] where important pixels increase in magnitude and less important pixels become smaller in absolute value, producing a visual effect on the SmoothGrad map very explicative.\\\n",
        "Let us then try to replicate this concept in tabular data, expecting the same effect but taking into account features instead of pixels:\\\n",
        "below we can see how with a noise level of 20% the differences between the values without and with noise are almost negative for features with small initially values, and have a zero or positive balance for initially higher value features. This is in fact the concept of **sharpening** described in [2], that basically tend to highlight some features and trow it down the ones less informative wrt the output."

There are dozens of possible variations on feature attribution methods, which may or may not provide better results (see [4] for a benchmarking and this nice [Distill blog post](https://distill.pub/2020/attribution-baselines/)). **[Integrated Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365)** are an interesting example, where the saliency is integrated over a path ranging from an empty input to the true input. Try implementing integrated gradients.\n",

One example of such methods is TracIn [5], which stores checkpoints of the model during training and evaluates the correlation of the gradients. Try to implement TracIn or any other metric of data influence.\n",

A recent line of research tries to use large language models (e.g., ChatGPT) to explain other models (e.g., see [Language models can explain neurons in language models](https://openai.com/research/language-models-can-explain-neurons-in-language-models)). If you have access to an LLM, you can try it! Take a specific neuron in the model, and collect the activation for multiple examples. Provide these activations to the LLM, and prompt it to provide a human-understandable explanation. What is the result?"
